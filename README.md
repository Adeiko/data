# DynastyProcess.com Data Repository

This repository contains resources and data for the purpose of supporting apps and developers, and is updated on a weekly basis.

The old database.csv was getting a little unwieldy (80+ columns) so it's been/being broken down into smaller, more specific pieces.

The main files available are: 

- db_playerids.csv
- values.csv (and sibling files values-players.csv and values-picks.csv)

and a few more to come! 

(Feel free to open an issue if you're looking for something specific from the previous database, we've got most of the data still!)

A number of older files were moved into the `archives/` folder and are likely out of date.
