# Apps

#### *[aka "LOOK AT THE SHINY!"]*

Joe Sydlowski ()[@JoeSydlowskiFF](http://twitter.com/JoeSydlowskiFF)), a great friend of mine, has done some incredible work building web apps using DynastyProcess data.

### Database

Web App: [apps.dynastyprocess.com/database](http://apps.dynastyprocess.com/database)

Details: [main Database info page](/downloads/database)

This app creates a much more user-friendly way to browse the rapidly-growing DynastyProcess database - making it very simple to drill down to the columns and rows that you might be interested in.

It is automatically updated when the database is updated.

### Arbitrage

Web App: [apps.dynastyprocess.com/arbitrage](http://apps.dynastyprocess.com/arbitrage)

Details: [main Arbitrage App info page](/downloads/arbitrage)

This app uses a Euclidean distance algorithm to help find the most comparable players based on criteria selected from the DynastyProcess database.
