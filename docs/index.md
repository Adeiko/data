## Finding method in the madness of DynastyFF

Hi, I'm Tan. I currently run [DynastyDashboard.com](http://www.dynastydashboard.com) and publish Excel tools and value charts for DynastyFF. 

## Plans
This site will be the future home of my writing and analysis tools. As the name suggests, I want to write about the process-side of DynastyFF - strategy, game theory, timelines, commissioner-bylaws, and more. 

More to come!
