# About

Hi, I'm Tan. You might know me as the person behind DynastyDashboard.com, where I published Excel tools and value charts for DynastyFF. DynastyProcess.com is a pivot on the project, containing of all of those tools as well as incorporating writing on strategy, game theory, data, rules, and more.

I'm also super stoked to include some fantastic web-apps built by Joe Sydlowski ([@JoeSydlowskiFF](http://twitter.com/JoeSydlowskiFF)) based on the data!

### Quick Links: [Database](/database) | [Values](/values) | [Calculator](/calculator) => now with a [Web App](https://apps.dynastyprocess.com/calculator)!

# Featured Project: [Database](/database)
#### > [Web App](http://apps.dynastyprocess.com/database), [CSV](https://github.com/tanho63/dynastyprocess/blob/master/files/database.csv), [Excel workbook](https://github.com/tanho63/dynastyprocess/blob/master/files/database-excel-macro.xlsm)

My ongoing project for the last little while - this database aggregates a ton of data, including:

- FantasyPros ECR for dynasty and redraft
- 2018 fantasy data (including AirYards!)
- Spotrac contract data
- Snap Counts from Pro-Football-Reference
- Draft athletic data from RAS (shoutout to Kent Lee Platte [@MathBomb](https://twitter.com/MathBomb))
- MFL/Sleeper/nflGSIS/Rotoworld/ESPN/PFR IDs for easy extensions to other things!

You can connect to the raw CSV posted on GitHub via a Google Sheet or any other data-import tool and it'll automatically update when I update the data :smiley: Future extensions: college market share/statistics, some kind of prospect film grade, expected fantasy points, and more.

More to come!
