Hi, I'm Tan. You might know me as the person behind [DynastyDashboard.com](http://www.dynastydashboard.com), where I published Excel tools and value charts for DynastyFF. 

DynastyProcess.com is the new home of my work: containing of all of those tools as well as being a home for my writing and analysis. The name change is symbolic of some of the directional changes I'd like to make - expanding from a focus on customized information and tools to also incorporating thoughts on strategy, game theory, data, rules, and more. 

# Latest Project

## [Database](/downloads/database/) > [Web App](http://dynastyprocess.shinyapps.io/dynastyprocess), [CSV](https://github.com/tanho63/dynastyprocess/blob/master/files/database.csv), and [Excel](https://github.com/tanho63/dynastyprocess/blob/master/files/database-excel-macro.xlsm)

My ongoing project for the last little while - this database aggregates a ton of data, including:

- FantasyPros ECR for dynasty and redraft
- 2018 AirYards.com data
- Spotrac contract data
- Snap Counts from Pro-Football-Reference
- Draft athletic data from RAS (shoutout to Kent Lee Platte [@MathBomb](https://twitter.com/MathBomb))
- MFL/Sleeper/nflGSIS/Rotoworld/ESPN/PFR IDs for easy extensions to other things! 

You can connect to the raw CSV posted on GitHub via a Google Sheet or any other data-import tool and it'll automatically update when I update the data :smile: Future extensions: college market share/statistics, some kind of prospect film grade, expected fantasy points, and more.

More to come!
