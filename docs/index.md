Hi, I'm Tan. You might know me as the person behind [DynastyDashboard.com](http://www.dynastydashboard.com), where I published Excel tools and value charts for DynastyFF. 

DynastyProcess.com is the new home of my work: containing of all of those tools as well as being a home for my writing and analysis. The name change is symbolic of some of the directional changes I'd like to make - expanding from a focus on customized information and tools to also incorporating thoughts on strategy, game theory, data, rules, and more. 

# Links and Downloads

**Database** - [CSV format](https://github.com/tanho63/dynastyprocess/blob/master/files/database.csv) and [Excel workbook format](https://github.com/tanho63/dynastyprocess/blob/master/files/database-excel-macro.xlsm). 

My ongoing project for the last little while - this database aggregates a ton of data, including:

- FantasyPros ECR for dynasty and redraft
- 2018 AirYards.com data
- Spotrac contract data
- Snap Counts from Pro-Football-Reference
- Draft athletic data from RAS (shoutout to Kent Lee Platte [@MathBomb](https://twitter.com/MathBomb))
- MFL/Sleeper/nflGSIS/Rotoworld/ESPN/PFR IDs for easy extensions to other things! 

You can connect to the raw CSV posted on GitHub via a Google Sheet or any other data-import tool and it'll automatically update when I update the data :smiley: Future extensions: college market share/statistics, some kind of prospect film grade, expected fantasy points, and more.

[**FantasyPros Weekly Scrapes**](https://github.com/tanho63/dynastyprocess/tree/master/files/fantasypros%20weekly%20scrapes) - this is a weekly scrape of FantasyPros ECR pages - eventually to be used for tracking risers and fallers!

[**Player Market Values**](https://dynastydashboard.tanho.ca/downloads/values) - this is the classic set of DynastyDashboard values posted as a Google Sheet. Assumes standard dynasty formats. 

[**Trade Calculator**](https://dynastydashboard.tanho.ca/downloads/calculator) - this is a trade calculator based on the Player Market Values sheet. 

The downloads page at [**DynastyDashboard.com**](http://www.dynastydashboard.com/downloads) still has the same tools as before (I'll write up descriptions and move more links over here later.)


More to come!
