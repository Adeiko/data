# Five Minute Projections: the Wisdom of Crowds at Work
February 8, 2019

In August 2018 [Justin Freeman](http://www.twitter.com/JustinFreeman18) ran an open projections contest called Leader of the PAC, attracting some incredible fantasy professionals like Mike Clay, Anthony Amico, and Peter Howard. I'm rather proud to say that my projections placed 9th out of 31 entries, finishing ahead of all three of those guys.

**I have a secret though - I did absolutely no team or player research when I made these projections!** Instead, I simply combined two things: the freshest possible FantasyPros redraft ranks I could manage to get my hands on, and a database I'd made of historical player PPR points-per-game production. My workflow looked like this: 1) Wait for the very last possible day to submit projections. 2) Refresh the scraper query. 3) Copy and paste the data to the table. No agonizing, no thinking, no actual analysis - just plug and play. 

## Method

1) I downloaded a database of recent player fantasy seasons ([FFStatistics.com](http://www.ffstatistics.com) has a pretty good database available) and drilled it down to just the data I wanted: 2013-2017 PPR points-per-game for each position. It looked a bit like this:

2) From there, I ranked each season by PPG for each position and averaged that rank across the five years of data
