### About
Inspired by similar projects found at [RotoViz](https://www.rotoviz.com), this app uses Euclidean distance-minimization to find the most similar five (or ten) players based on selected criteria from the [DynastyProcess database](/downloads/database). This, coupled with the FantasyPros consensus ranks, helps gives some objective data as to a) whether you should buy/sell a certain player and b) what alternatives you might have to them.

### Some Suggested Combinations

This tool is extremely flexible - you can search by literally as many or as few columns as you'd like.

If you're not sure which sets of data to start with, here are a few that Joe and I recommend as starting points for each position:

Position | Comparison Type | Variables
:---|:---:|:---
QB | general |  age, draftround, tm_paATTs, tm_airYDs, PACR, AYA, EP
RB| opportunity | draftround, tgtshare, carries, expected points, snappct
RB | efficiency | YPC, abswopr, ruTDs, reTDs, ppr/g
RB| athletic/metric| age, height, weight, forty,
WR|opportunity| wopr, adot, tm_paATTs, tm_airYDs
WR|efficiency|racr,reTDs,ppr/g
WR|athletic/metric|age, height, forty, weight,
TE|

Feel free to include any statistics that you might feel are relevant or predictive - and share any interesting comparisons with us!
