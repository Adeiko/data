# Frequently Asked Questions

#### How do I use the Trade Calculator?

Please go to File > Make A Copy and save it to your Google Drive. Don't worry, it'll still be connected to the Market Values sheet and will update every time the values are updated!

#### What is a Fudge Factor?

A "Fudge Factor" is used to help create a window where the trade is essentially equal or where the difference is so small that it can be chalked up to a difference in opinion. The baseline is 5%.

#### What is the Trade Wizard?

I originally created the Trade Wizard to help identify targets for package deals (many-to-one). It'll identify potential trade targets that are up to [Variance Factor]% more or less than the package total. 
A popular axiom for dynasty owners is that a dollar is worth more than five quarters, which is to say that one elite player is worth more than five role players that theoretically add up to the same value. To account for this, there is a [Package Penalty]% that reduces the upper and lower limits of player targets based on the number of players in a package.
