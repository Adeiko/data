# Links and Downloads

[**DynastyProcess.com Database**](/downloads/database) - an attempt to aggregate all of the possible sources of player-data. Also good for linking to player IDs! 

[**FantasyPros Weekly Scrapes**](https://github.com/tanho63/dynastyprocess/tree/master/files/fantasypros%20weekly%20scrapes) - this is a weekly scrape of FantasyPros ECR pages - eventually to be used for tracking risers and fallers!

[**Player Market Values**](https://dynastydashboard.tanho.ca/downloads/values) - this is the classic set of DynastyDashboard values posted as a Google Sheet. Assumes standard dynasty formats. 

[**Trade Calculator**](https://dynastydashboard.tanho.ca/downloads/calculator) - this is a trade calculator based on the Player Market Values sheet. 

The downloads page at [**DynastyDashboard.com**](http://www.dynastydashboard.com/downloads) still has the same tools as before (I'll write up descriptions and move more links over here later.)


More to come!
