### Databases

[**DynastyProcess.com Database**](/downloads/database) - an attempt to aggregate all possible sources of dynasty-relevant player-data. Also good for linking player IDs! 

[**FantasyPros Weekly Scrapes**](/downloads/fpscrapes) - this is a weekly scrape of FantasyPros ECR pages - eventually to be used for tracking risers and fallers!

### Player Values

[**Market Values**](/downloads/values) - this is the classic set of DynastyDashboard values posted as a Google Sheet. Assumes standard dynasty formats. Algorithm is given so that you can tweak it to your liking - although no promises that your liking will match your leaguemates. Can be linked to other Google Sheets via IMPORTRANGE. 

[**Trade Calculator**](/downloads/calculator) - this is a simple Google Sheets-based trade calculator based on the Market Values sheet.

### League Analysis Tools
**[Potential Points Calculators](/downloads/potentialpoints)** - Excel sheets I built to help calculate Potential Points for ESPN and Yahoo leagues. Requires Excel for Windows and PowerQuery. 

**[Win Probability Tools](/downloads/winprobability)** - an Excel sheet I built as a fun experiment to help guess at expected regular-season finishes in MFL leagues. Uses All-Play Win Percentage as an estimate of team strength. 

### News
**[Slack Aggregator](/downloads/slack)** - a Slack Channel I made that aggregates RSS feeds for NFL news, draft/film prospects, stats/data analytics, and more.
